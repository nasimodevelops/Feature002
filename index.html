                     <p class="post-excerpt has-text-white is-size-5">The band Sins And Preachers is really just one man, Charlie Shaw. 
                         Charlie wrote and recorded the album “Tell Me A Lie” in his bedroom playing all the instruments for the songs and producing the final sound himself. 
                         However he couldn’t have done it alone. The EP features two incredibly talented guest singers, Gwen Hughes and Phillipa Tarr. In total there are six songs, 
                         all with their own story and background personal to Charlie. His favourite story behind a song is the history behind the fifth track, “Olivia”. 
                         The song tells a story of heartbreak and toxic romance between Charlie and an old friend. </p>

                   <p class="post-excerpt has-text-white is-size-6">Releasing an EP as a one man studio band has been a major dream of Charlie’s over the last few years. 
                       Charlie wrote and recorded all the music over six months with nothing but a guitar, IPad and a keyboard. 
                       The main goal behind his EP was to create something he was proud of. </p>
                       <br>
                       <p class="post-excerpt has-text-white is-size-6">Over the six months he put in great
                        amounts of effort writing all the music and lyrics, as well as learning to play piano and record everything 
                        with the limited equipment he had. Eventually after all the hard work and obsessive dedication the album is 
                        finished and the indie, acoustic, psychedelic music is out for the world to hear.

                   <h1 class="title has-text-black post-title">Sins and Preachers Sound & Inspirations</h1>
                   <p class="post-excerpt has-text-white is-size-5">Charlie’s main inspirations for the sound of his EP were Harry Styles, Amy Winehouse and the band Vundabar.
                        Sins And Preachers’ genre could be described as indie rock however some songs from their new EP have more acoustic folk roots such as “Bees Will Be Bees” and “Crayon Love”. 
                       Crayon Love was the first song written and released by Charlie under the name Sins And Preachers.</p>
